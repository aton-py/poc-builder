#ðŸ”¥ How to turn any web app in low-code boilerplate ðŸ”¥

Builder.io is a visual CMS that allows integration with any stack, both front-end and back-end. Its promise is to decouple product, design and marketing processes from the development process, focusing on creating components that can be managed, edited and modified in a drag-and-drop editor.
Imagine that your site has one or more campaigns that are no longer valid, and that when you close a campaign, the content must be removed immediately. To avoid legal problems for disclosing something that is no longer valid, this is an urgent demand on the development team's board, which ends up having to accommodate the demand, often interrupting other activities in progress, causing work overload. In this model, developers become a content management tool, which depending on the business model can be more important than improving the software itself.
In this scenario, Builder.io comes as a different proposal from other low-code / no-code platforms. With Builder.io you empower the marketing, product and design teams, so that the components can be managed without having to become demands on the development team. That is, if there is a demand to reorder sections, just do it through the visual CMS and then publish the changes, which will reflect automatically. The same goes for obsolete campaigns, pages to be changed, in short, anything.
But, what about the development team, will it end?
It is impossible to deny that part of the demand that makes up many business models changes, as developers are not dependent on making simple changes to their product, but the development team will finally be able to focus on what really matters, such as:
- Performance
- Pixel-perfect components
- Code quality and reuse
- Unit and integration tests
